and once all dependencies have installed, run

```

## How to use

Login using a full name (Sam Davies, Esther Sanchez) to use the app as a user. Alternatively, log in as Alena Stout to use the app as a chef.

Once, as a user, you pick your preferences, the chef gets a list of suggestions, which can be modified and finally published. Then, as a user, you can make your selection and the order count will be displayed on the chef's ui.
